# Devdroid-ROM
Born out of frustration with unreliable Android dev tools. Introducing: DevDroid-ROM, a custom AOSP-based ROM offering a secure, integrated development environment. It includes a built-in Bash shell, Python interpreter, and GCC/Clang toolchain, enabling seamless coding, compiling, and scripting directly on Androidâ€”no external tools needed.

# DevDroid-ROM: Custom Developer Toolkit for Android

## Overview
DevDroid-ROM is a custom Android ROM based on AOSP (Android Open Source Project) designed to bring a powerful development environment directly to Android devices. Inspired by Linux environments, it integrates essential developer tools directly into the Android OS, including:

- Bash shell for native command-line interactions
- Python interpreter for scripting and development
- GCC/Clang toolchain for compiling C/C++ code directly on the device

## Features
- Embedded Shell: Full Bash shell embedded into the Android system, accessible from the native terminal.
- Developer Tools: Preinstalled Python and GCC/Clang for development on the go, without needing external tools or emulators.
- Custom Environment: Optimized build environment to mimic a Linux terminal setup.

## Project Goals
1. Provide a seamless development experience on Android devices.
2. Enable native compilation and script execution for developers directly on their devices.
3. Integrate tools commonly used in software development, including Python, Bash, and GCC.

## Installation
> Instructions for building, flashing, and testing the ROM will be added as development progresses.

## Build Instructions
1. Clone the AOSP source.
2. Sync the specific device configuration (for x86 or arm64).
3. Add the custom Bash, Python, and GCC components.
4. Build the ROM.

*Note: Detailed steps will be added soon.*

## Future Plans
- Integrate additional developer tools (Git, Vim, etc.)
- Provide support for more Android versions and devices
- Optimize for smaller storage usage and performance
